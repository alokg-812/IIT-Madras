- When comparing `t(n)` , we generally focus on the **order of the magnitude**-
- * Ex-
  * `f(n)=n^3` eventually grows faster than `g(n)=5000(n^2)`
### How to Compare?ðŸ¤”
- Upper Bound- `Big-Oh[O]`
  * shows the worst case scenario for how long the algorithm might take.
  * even for the largest input, Big-Oh is the maximum specific rate.
- Lower Bound- `Omega[Î©]`
  * shows the best case scenario
- Tightly Bound- `Theta[Î˜]`
  * describes the exact time growth, representing both upper and lower limits.
  * most realistics estimate
