- When comparing `t(n)` , we generally focus on the **order of the magnitude**-
- * Ex-
  * `f(n)=n^3` eventually grows faster than `g(n)=5000(n^2)`
### How to Compare?ðŸ¤”
- Upper Bound- `Big-Oh[O]`
  * shows the worst case scenario for how long the algorithm might take.
  * even for the largest input, Big-Oh is the maximum specific rate.
- Lower Bound- `Omega[Î©]`
  * shows the best case scenario
- Tightly Bound- `Theta[Î˜]`
  * describes the exact time growth, representing both upper and lower limits.
  * most realistics estimate

### Calculating complexities:
```
    a = 10
    b = 20
    s = a + b
    print(s)
```
**Complexity = `O(1)`**

Complexity for single loop
```
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
    	s = s + 1
```
**Complexity = `O(n)`**

Complexity for nested two loop
```
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            s = s + 1
```
**Complexity = `O(nÂ²)`**

Complexity for nested three loop
```
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n)
            	s = s + 1
```
**Complexity = `O(nÂ³)`** 

Complexity for combination of all
```
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
    	s = s + 1
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            s = s + 1
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n)
            	s = s + 1
```
**Complexity = `O(nÂ³)`**


Complexity for recursive solution
```
    def factorial(n)
    	if (n == 0):
    		return 1
    	return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Recurrence relation? `T(n) = T(n-1)+O(1) = 1+1+1...n times`

**Complexity `O(n)`**

 

Complexity for recursive solution
```
    def merge(A,B):
        #statement block for merging two sorted array
    def mergesort(A):
        n = len(A)
        if n <= 1:
            return(A)
        L = mergesort(A[:n//2])
        R = mergesort(A[n//2:])
        B = merge(L,R)
        return(B) 
```
Recurrence relation - `T(n)=2T(n/2) + O(n)`

**Complexity `O(nlogn)`**

## Searching Algorithms:
### Naive Approach:
Searching through all values:
```
    def naiveSearch(val,ls):
        for x in ls:
            if x == val:
                return True
        return False
        
    ls = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]
    print(naiveSearch(8,ls))
    print(naiveSearch(13,ls))
```
`Best Case: O(n)`
`Worst Case: O(n)`
`Average Case: O(n)`

### Binary Search Approach:
Binary search is an efficient search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted list. The algorithm compares the target value to the middle element of the list. If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete. Otherwise, the algorithm recursively searches either the left or right half of the list, depending on whether the target value is greater or less than the middle element.
```
# Searching in a sorted list
    def binary_search(sorted_list, target):
        low = 0
        high = len(sorted_list) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if sorted_list[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif sorted_list[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return -1
    
    ls = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]
    print(binary_search(ls, 11))
```
`Best Case: O(1)`
`Worst Case: O(logn)`
`Average Case: O(logn)`
