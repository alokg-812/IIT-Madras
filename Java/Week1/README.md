## Programming Languages
- A lang. is a medium of communication.
- A programming lang. is a medium of communication to instruct computers.

- Originally (in low level programming), the direct architecture was:
    - Memory locations store values, registers allow arithmetics.
    - Load a value from memory location `M` to register `R`.
    - Add the contents of register `R1` and `R2` and store the result back in `R1`.
    - Write the value in `R1` to memory location `M'`.

> This is very tedious and error-prone process.
