# Week 1

## Programming Languages
- A lang. is a medium of communication.
- A programming lang. is a medium of communication to instruct computers.

- Originally (in low level programming), the direct architecture was:
    - Memory locations store values, registers allow arithmetics.
    - Load a value from memory location `M` to register `R`.
    - Add the contents of register `R1` and `R2` and store the result back in `R1`.
    - Write the value in `R1` to memory location `M'`.

> This is very tedious and error-prone process.

### Abstraction 
* Abstractions used in `computational thinking`
  - Assigning values to named variables
  - Conditional execution
  - Iteration
  - Functions/ procedures, recursion
  - Aggregate data structures - arrays, lists , dictionaries.
* Expressing these ideas in programming language produces what we call `compilers` or `interpreters`.

### Styles of programming
* Imperative
* Declarative

* Imperative
  * How to computer
  * Step by step instructions on what is to be done
* Declarative
  * What the computatuin should produce
  * Often exploit inductive structure, express in terms of smaller computations
  * Typically avoid using intermediate variables
  * Combination of small transformations - `functional programming`
