### File system: traversing the tree
- `/` is the `root` of the file system.
- `/` is also the `delimiter` for sub-directories
- `.` is `current directory`
- `..` is `parent directory`
> Path for traversal can be absolute or relative

**eg#1:**
```bash
alok@AlokThinkbook:/mnt/c/Users/alokg/mnt/c/Users/alokg/Desktop/madras/SC cd .. // this will take us to the parent directory
```
