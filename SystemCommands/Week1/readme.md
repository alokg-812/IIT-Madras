üóÇÔ∏è Man Page Sections
The Linux manual is organized into sections. You can specify the section when needed:

| Section | Description                   |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 1       | User commands (e.g., ls, pwd) |
| 2       | System calls                  |
| 3       | Library functions             |
| 4       | Special files (e.g., devices) |
| 5       | File formats                  |
| 6       | Games                         |
| 7       | Miscellaneous                 |
| 8       | System admin commands         |
| 9       | Kernel routines               |

ex#:
```yml
alok@AlokThinkbook:/mnt/c/Users/alokg/Desktop/madras/SC/week1$ man 1 ls
# Shows the 'ls' command from section 1 (user commands)
```
