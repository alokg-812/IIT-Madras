#### GRPA 1:
We created some directories and change our current working directory using the cd command as given by the sequence of commands below. Write a bash command to make the directory `level2` as your current working directory. i.e. after executing your solution, if we execute the command `pwd` it should return the path of the directory `level2`. <br> <br>
**Ques:** Write your solution as a single line bash command.
```bash	
cd /
mkdir level1
cd level1
mkdir level2
cd level2
mkdir level3
cd ..
cd ..
```

#### GRPA 2:
We have a file named `systemcommands.txt` in the present working directory. Write a Bash command to change its permissions to

``
user: read, write, execute
group: execute
others: write
``
