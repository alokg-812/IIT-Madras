# Week 3

## Lecture 1 Combining commands & files

## **1. Networks and IP Addressing**

## ✅ **Public vs Private Networks**

* A **public network** is accessible from the internet (like your college website).
* A **private network** is restricted to local machines (like your Wi-Fi at home).

### 🧾 **IP Address Ranges:**

These IP ranges are *reserved* for private use:

| Class | CIDR Notation  | Range Example | Use Case                      |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A     | 10.0.0.0/8     | 10.23.45.67   | Large companies' internal LAN |
| B     | 172.16.0.0/12  | 172.20.5.1    | Medium-sized orgs             |
| C     | 192.168.0.0/16 | 192.168.1.10  | Home/Office Wi-Fi             |
| —     | 127.0.0.0/8    | 127.0.0.1     | Loopback / localhost          |

🔁 **Loopback address (`127.0.0.1`)** refers to your own machine. Try `ping 127.0.0.1` — it will always respond if your network is working properly.

# 🌐 **2. Gateways and Routing**

Imagine three private networks in a university:

* CS Lab (Private Net #1)
* Mechanical Lab (Private Net #2)
* Admin Department (Private Net #3)

To send a file from CS Lab to Admin Department, data has to "hop" through **gateways** (devices that connect networks):

```
CS Lab --> Gateway 1-2 --> Gateway 2-3 --> Admin Dept
```

🛣️ This process is called **routing**. A router/gateway decides the best path to reach the destination.

# 🎯 **3. IP and Port Numbers**

## 🔌 **What is a Port?**

An IP address alone only points to a device. A **port number** tells which service on that device you want to communicate with.

### 🎯 Example:

You want to visit a website hosted on IP `123.45.67.89`.

* Browser requests go to:
  **123.45.67.89:80** → for HTTP
  **123.45.67.89:443** → for HTTPS

So:

* **IP Address** = House Address
* **Port Number** = Room Number

### 💡 Important Port-Protocol Pairs:

| Port | Protocol | Service                    |
| ---- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| 22   | TCP      | SSH – Remote login         |
| 21   | TCP      | FTP – File transfers       |
| 25   | TCP      | SMTP – Send Emails         |
| 80   | TCP      | HTTP – Websites (unsecure) |
| 443  | TCP      | HTTPS – Websites (secure)  |
| 3306 | TCP      | MySQL – Database server    |

# 🔑 **4. How to Access Remote Systems**

### 🛠️ **Tools for Remote Access:**

| Method             | Example Tools             | Notes                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| VPN                | OpenVPN, WireGuard        | Extends your private network remotely |
| SSH                | `ssh user@IP`             | CLI remote control                    |
| Remote Desktop     | RDP, X2Go, PCoIP          | GUI-based remote access               |
| Web-based Desktops | Apache Guacamole          | Access desktops through browser       |
| Commercial Tools   | TeamViewer, AnyDesk, Zoho | Cross-platform GUI remote access      |

# 🔥 **5. Firewall – The Security Guard**

A **firewall** is like a bouncer who decides which connections are allowed.

### 🔐 Firewall Checks:

* Is this **port** allowed?
* Is this **IP address** allowed?
* Is the **protocol (TCP/UDP)** safe?

Your firewall must **allow port 22** if you want to connect via SSH to your machine from outside.

# 🛡️ **6. Server Protection Layers**

To protect a public server, **multiple layers of security** are used:

1. **Web Application Filter** – Blocks SQL injection, XSS attacks, etc.
2. **Network Firewall** – Prevents unauthorized network access.
3. **SELinux** – Internal OS-level control (explained next).

---

# 🧱 **7. SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**

A powerful Linux security module.

### 🎯 What it Does:

* Prevents unauthorized access by services like Apache or MySQL.
* Enforces **least privilege**: processes get **only** what they need.

### 🧩 Components:

* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:

  * `user:role:type:level`
  * Example: `unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0`
* **Modes**:

  * `disabled` – turned off
  * `permissive` – logs only
  * `enforcing` – actively blocks

### 🔍 Useful Commands:

* `ls -lZ file.txt` → show security context of a file.
* `ps -eZ` → view running processes' contexts.
* `semanage port -l` → list SELinux port rules.

✅ **Recommended** for any internet-facing Linux server!

# 💻 **9. High Performance Computing (HPC)**

When working with **supercomputers or clusters**, like the ones used in IITs or research centers:

### 🧠 Basics:

* You don’t run programs directly—you submit them as **jobs**.
* Jobs are queued and managed by **schedulers** (like SLURM, PBS).
* Data processing is **done remotely** (don’t download 50GB raw data!).
* Most access is via **SSH**, so comfort with Linux command line is essential.
