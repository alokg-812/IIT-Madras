### Shell Variables
* In scripting (whether Bash, Zsh, etc.), _shell variables_ are used to `store data temporarily` during the execution of scripts or commands. 
* These variables can store `strings`, `numbers`, `file paths`, `command outputs`, etc.

### What Are Shell Variables?
Shell variables are like `placeholders` in our shell session or script. <br>
We can `assign a value` to a name and use it later.
