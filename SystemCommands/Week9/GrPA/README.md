# GrPA 1A
- Consider a file named `marks.csv` containing roll number and marks of variable number of subjects of students.
- The values are comma separated values and in the format
```
RollNo,Subject1,Subject2,Subject3,So on...
```
- Write an Awk command to print all the roll numbers(RollNo) in the file.

# GrPA 1B
- Write an Awk command to print the first field of the all the lines containing more than **20 characters** in the file `marks.csv`.
- The field separator in the file is comma (,).

# GrPA 1C
- Write an awk script to print the total number of fields in a csv file with the field separator as comma (,). 
- Print only the number and nothing else.

# GrPA 1D
- Write an Awk Script to print all the lines whose starting and ending character is a digit.
- Also print the count of these lines(only the number) on a new line at the last in your output. The field separator in the file is comma (,).
- Note, that here it is asked to write an Awk script. Read the Programming questions instructions for more clarity.

# GrPA 2
- A software company has published some best practices for writing the code. 
- One of the best practice mentioned is that if no line in your code should exceed 50 characters in total including all type of characters or spaces.
- Given a bash script that intends to print the names of all .c files that contain one or more lines with length more than 50 characters(as specified above).
- The awk script within this bash script to check the files as per above condition is missing in the code, complete that
