# GrPA 1:
* Write a bash `script.sh` which takes one argument as the name of a file and prints `Yes` if the file has read permission only for the owner and no other permissions for owner or other users, else do not print anything.
* The file given in the argument will be present in the current working directory.

# GrPA 2:
* Write a bash script that accepts a few arguments(all numbers) and performs the following functions.
* Prints the string Error if the number of arguments supplied is not equal to 2.
* If the number of arguments is equal to two, print their sum.
* [Solution](https://github.com/alokg-812/IIT-Madras/blob/main/SystemCommands/Week6/GrPA/GrPA2.bash)

# GrPA 3:
* Write a bash script that reads a value from the standard input stream and
  * prints `PNUM` if the value is a postive number or 0;
  * prints `NNUM` if it is a negative number;
  * else print `STRING`.

# GrPA 4:
* Write a bash script that takes any number of inputs(all numbers) and
  * prints the `maximum` and `minimum` value from all the inputs in the format
    ```
    Maximum: max | Minimum: min
    ```
  * where max is the maximum value and min is the minimum value.

# GrPA 5:
* Write a bash script that takes two integer values as input, and
* prints the `product table` of first integer with all the integers from 1 to the value in second argument as described in the format below.

#### eg#01:
Let the first argument be 3 and the second argument be 4, then your script should print.
```bash
3*1=3
3*2=6
3*3=9
3*4=12
```

#### eg#02:
If the first argument is 12 and second argument is 3, then your script should print
```
12*1=12
12*2=24
12*3=36
```
* Note that there is no space between any numbers, * or = sign in each line. And every product is printed on a new line.
