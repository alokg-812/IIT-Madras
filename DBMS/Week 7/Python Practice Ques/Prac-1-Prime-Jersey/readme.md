In this question, you have to write a Python program to print the names of the players and the team of each player of all those players whose _jersey number is a prime number_. 
1. The list should be ordered in reverse alphabetical order of player names. If two or more players have the same name, then further sorting should be done on the team name, again in reverse alphabetical order.
2. The format of output is as given below:
   > Name of the player, followed by a comma (,), then a space and then the team name.


For example, if `Arjun` has jersey number `5` and is playing for `All Stars` and `Pranav`, with jersey number `7`, is playing for team `Amigos`, then the output will be:
```
Pranav, Amigos
Arjun, All Stars
```
